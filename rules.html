        So, you want to learn to play My Cows.  Who could blame you?  It's the perfect
        game for any drive long enough to pass a few cow fields.  Below are the 
        holy and infallible laws of this sacred game.
        <ul>
            <li>If you see one or more cows, be the first to shout "my cows!", and 
                the cows are yours.  Each collection of cows, no matter how large,
                 adds 1 point to your score.  If cows are separated by fences or other
                  boundaries, they are separate units and can be claimed individually.  
                  Statues of cows count, but only if they are 3-dimensional.
            </li>
            <li>If you see a church steeple and call "my steeple!" first, your cows
                 all get married and have babies (your cows double).
            </li>
            <li>If you see a graveyard and call "my graveyard!" first, all of your 
                opponent's cows die instantly.
            </li>
            <li>if you see a goat(s) and call "my goats!" first, your cows become 
                happy and multiply by 1.5, rounding down. 
            </li>
            <li>If you see a Dollar General and call "my Dollar General!" first, 
                you gain one dollar.  Your dollar-count will be used to decide a 
                winner in the event of a cow tie.
            </li>
            <li>If you see one of those large store-yards full of sheds (it has 
                to be a collection of sheds), you have the option of calling "my 
                shed!".  This will permanently put 2 of your cows securely into a shed, 
                protecting them from graveyards, but also rendering them immune 
                to steeples.  This is a bit of a gamble.
            </li>
            <li>If your cows have been recently killed by a graveyard and you have 
                NOT YET gained any additional cows, you can revive your dead cows 
                by spotting an animal hospital and calling "my animal hospital!".  
                However, if you have gained any cows since your cows were killed, 
                this is no longer an option.
            </li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
