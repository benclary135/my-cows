# my-cows
This web app was my attempt at making an interactive scorekeeping interface for the driving game "My Cows".  At the time of making this, I have just recently become acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and thought that this would be a good way to test my skills with all three at once, although obviously this project focuses more heavily on the JavaScript and doesn't pay much attention to the CSS, apart from using some FlexBox skills.  
All in all, I think this was a very beneficial exercise for me.  In order to actually create an app that did everything I wanted it to, I was forced to learn several things that I had no clue how to do beforehand, and become more comfortable with skills that I already knew, but did not have much practice with.  Some especially valuable skills I learned while making this were calling js functions with HTML buttons, creating objects with multiple attributes that frequently update, and making an HTML element that updates automatically when functions are called.  In addition to this, I became more confident in my HTML structuring, as well as my ability to use Chrome DevTools.
